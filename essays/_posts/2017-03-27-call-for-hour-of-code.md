title: Calling Progamming Communities to the Hour of Code
language: en
---

Dear Progamming language communities,

Programming is becomming main stream for about four years, now.
It is taught to children in a playful way, starting with the Hour of Code.
At least in Germany, England and the USA, Hour of Code is strong.
Worldwide programming initiatives like [CoderDojo][zen] use Hour of Code.

I am seeing Imperative Programmig languages used in almost all tutorials.
I am missing **LISP**, **Haskell**, **Prolog**, **Smalltalk**, languages that
shaped my thinking and I am grateful to know their concepts.

I fear:

- The next generation will go without them if we do not teach an Hour of Code
  in these languages.
- Your ideas will extinct in two generations if we fail to reduce the
  access barriers to an Hour of Code.

Here is my call:

**Please create an hour of code in your language for the sake of humanity's diversity of thinking in programming languages.**

The train is arriving. Hop on, do not miss it.
