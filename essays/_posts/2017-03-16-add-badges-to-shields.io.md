---

I wrote a tutorial on how to add badges to [shields.io](http://shields.io/).
You can view it [here](https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md#tutorial-on-how-to-add-a-badge-for-a-service).
There is a [pull request](https://github.com/badges/shields/pull/889) for it.
As soon as the pull request is merged, new improvements may come.
You should be able to see it [here](https://github.com/badges/shields).
